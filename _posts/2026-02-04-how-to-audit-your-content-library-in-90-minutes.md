If you've been coaching or consulting for three or more years, you're sitting on a mountain of content. Recorded calls, course modules, workshop decks, written frameworks, email sequences, PDF guides, Loom videos, webinar replays. It's everywhere. Google Drive. Dropbox. Your course platform. Your email marketing tool. Random folders on your desktop.

You know it's there. You've probably thought, "I should really do something with all that." And then your next client call starts and you forget about it for another six months.

Today, we're going to fix that. In 90 minutes.

This isn't a "reorganize your entire digital life" exercise. This is a focused audit designed to help you see what you have, identify what's most valuable, and find the specific revenue opportunities hiding inside your existing intellectual property.

Grab a coffee. Block 90 minutes on your calendar. Let's go.

## Before You Start: What You'll Need

- A blank spreadsheet (Google Sheets, Excel, whatever you use)
- Access to wherever your content lives (Google Drive, course platform, Zoom recordings, etc.)
- A timer (seriously, time-boxing each section matters)

Set up your spreadsheet with these columns:
- Content Title / Description
- Format (video, doc, slides, audio, etc.)
- Original Purpose (course module, coaching call, workshop, lead magnet, etc.)
- Core Topic / Theme
- Leverage Score (we'll get to this)

Ready? Start the clock.

## Minutes 1-30: The Inventory Sweep

**Goal:** Get everything on the list. Don't judge. Don't organize. Just catalog.

Start with your biggest content repository and work through each platform. You're not watching or reading anything. You're just scanning titles and adding entries to your spreadsheet.

**Hit these locations in order:**

**Your course platform** (Kajabi, Teachable, Thinkific, etc.)
- List every module, every lesson, every bonus resource
- Don't skip the stuff from courses you've retired. That content still has value.

**Your Google Drive / Dropbox**
- Look for folders related to coaching programs, workshops, speaking engagements, training materials
- Include slide decks, PDF guides, workbooks, templates, frameworks

**Your Zoom / recording platform**
- Coaching call recordings (even if they're unedited)
- Workshop recordings
- Webinar replays
- Masterclass recordings

**Your email platform**
- Saved email sequences
- Newsletter archives
- Launch sequences

**Your social media**
- Any long-form posts you've written (LinkedIn articles, blog posts)
- Saved video content

**Your notes and docs**
- Frameworks you've sketched out
- Client process documents
- Onboarding materials
- SOPs you've written

You don't need to be exhaustive in 30 minutes. You need to be FAST. Scan, add the title and format, move on. You're aiming for a minimum of 30-50 entries, but most coaches who've been at it for 3+ years end up with 75-150.

Don't get distracted. Don't start re-reading old materials. Catalog and move.

## Minutes 30-50: The Theme Mapping

**Goal:** Identify the 5-7 core themes that show up repeatedly across your content.

Now look at your list. Start filling in the "Core Topic / Theme" column. But here's the key: don't use granular topics. Use broad themes.

For example, if you're a leadership coach, your themes might be:
- Executive presence and communication
- Team dynamics and conflict
- Decision-making under pressure
- Career transitions
- Managing up
- Work-life integration
- First-time manager challenges

You'll start to see patterns immediately. Certain themes will show up over and over. That coaching call from 2023 and that course module from 2025 and that LinkedIn post from last month all address the same underlying topic.

**Color-code or tag your top 5 themes.** These are the pillars of your intellectual property. This is what you're known for, what clients come to you for, and what your content library is really about.

Write those 5 themes at the top of your spreadsheet. These are your leverage points.

## Minutes 50-70: The Leverage Scoring

**Goal:** Identify which content has the highest potential for reuse and revenue generation.

Go through your inventory and score each item from 1-5 on its leverage potential. Here's the rubric:

**Score 5: High leverage.** This content explains a proprietary framework, addresses a problem your ideal clients consistently face, and could be understood by someone without prior context from you. It's evergreen and not tied to a specific client situation.

**Score 4: Strong leverage.** Good foundational content that might need minor editing to be repurposed. Still relevant and valuable.

**Score 3: Moderate leverage.** Useful content but somewhat specific to a particular engagement or time period. Could be adapted with some work.

**Score 2: Low leverage.** Too specific, too dated, or too context-dependent to repurpose easily.

**Score 1: Archive it.** Not worth revisiting. Old, irrelevant, or superseded by better versions of the same content.

Don't overthink this. Go with your gut. Spend no more than 10-15 seconds scoring each item.

When you're done, sort by leverage score. Your 4s and 5s are the goldmine.

## Minutes 70-85: The Opportunity Map

**Goal:** Identify three specific ways to activate your highest-leverage content.

Look at your top-scoring content and ask these three questions:

### Question 1: What Could Become Social Media Content?

Which of your 4s and 5s contain insights, frameworks, or stories that could be broken into social media posts?

A single 60-minute workshop recording might contain 10-15 individual insights that would each make a compelling LinkedIn post. A course module might contain a framework that could be explained in a carousel. A coaching call (anonymized) might contain a breakthrough moment that would resonate with your audience.

List the top 5 items that could be mined for social content. This is where a tool like [ContentBee](https://contentbee.oughtabee.ai) becomes really valuable. It can take your existing content and automatically transform it into social media posts, keeping you visible without you having to manually extract and rewrite every insight.

### Question 2: What Could Become a Self-Service Resource?

Which of your 4s and 5s could answer questions that clients or prospects ask you repeatedly?

Think about the questions you answer on every single discovery call. The explanations you give in the first session of every coaching engagement. The frameworks you walk through with every new client.

If that content already exists in recorded or written form, you could build a resource library, a FAQ section, or an automated onboarding sequence that delivers this material BEFORE you ever get on a call. That's hours of your time recovered every month.

List the top 3 items that could reduce your personal time investment in repetitive delivery.

### Question 3: What Could Become a Scalable Offer?

This is the big one. Which of your 4s and 5s represents a methodology or framework that could be packaged and delivered to more people without your direct involvement?

This could look like:
- A self-paced mini-course based on your most-requested framework
- A group program built around content you've already created
- A diagnostic tool based on your assessment process
- An automated coaching sequence that delivers your methodology between live sessions

List the top 2 items with the most potential for a scalable offer.

## Minutes 85-90: The Priority Decision

**Goal:** Pick ONE thing to do first.

You now have three lists:
1. Content that could fuel your social media presence
2. Content that could save you time through self-service
3. Content that could become a scalable revenue stream

Don't try to do all three at once. Pick the one that would have the biggest impact on your business RIGHT NOW.

If your pipeline is thin and you need more visibility: start with #1. Get your existing insights out into the world consistently.

If you're drowning in repetitive delivery and need to free up hours: start with #2. Build the resource library that answers questions before they reach your calendar.

If you've maxed out your revenue ceiling and need a new income stream: start with #3. Package your best framework into something that doesn't require your live presence.

Write down your choice. Write down the first three action steps to make it happen. Put those action steps on your calendar for this week.

## What Most People Discover

I'll tell you what most coaches realize when they do this exercise.

They're shocked by how much they've created. The sheer volume of intellectual property, sitting in folders and platforms, untouched and unmonetized.

They're frustrated that they've been spending hours every week trying to create NEW content when they already have a library full of proven material.

And they're energized. Because for the first time, they can SEE the path from where they are to where they want to be. And it doesn't require creating more. It requires activating what's already there.

## Your 90 Minutes Start Now

Block the time. Do the audit. See what you find.

I'm willing to bet you'll discover more revenue potential in your existing content library than in any new offer, any new hire, or any new marketing strategy you could come up with.

The content is already built. The expertise is already captured. The hard part is done.

Now go find it.
