To use Trevor's real headshot: replace `assets/trevor-headshot.svg` with a square photo (e.g. `assets/trevor-headshot.jpg`), then in `_layouts/default.html`, `index.html`, and `_layouts/post.html` change the img `src` from `trevor-headshot.svg` to `trevor-headshot.jpg` (or add a second image and update the paths).
